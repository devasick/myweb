A very simple visitor tracking tool using PHP and MySQL

Nothing particularly complex, just outlines a few of the basic principles of detecting users and logging their details. Feel free to use this code for whatever purpose.

To see the script in action

1) Setup a database using the SQL script in visitor_tracking.sql

2) Setup your database access details in db_connect.php

3) visit the pages

visitor_tracking_page1.php
visitor_tracking_page2.php
visitor_tracking_page3.php

- This will log some visits into the database

4) View the results in ip_report.php
